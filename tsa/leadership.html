In November, the Regional Leadership Conference for all students in the Rio Grande Valley takes place, and members are exposed to opportunities to grow at the university level. In December, a three-day leadership conference for all students in the state of Texas takes place in Kerrville, and members can grow exponentially through the leadership skills they learn there.</p>
