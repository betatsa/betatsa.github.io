      <h5 class="medium-blue-text center">Competition and Leadership are two huge components of TSA. However, community service is an integral part of the organization, and they give members the opportunity to give back to their community and show how thankful they are to be members</h5>

            <h4 class="dark-blue-text center">BETA TSA's Service Projects</h4>
            <p class="light center">Over the years, BETA TSA has felt the strong need to give back to the community that has supported it over the years. We are involved in various service projects, and our members are integral parts of their success.<br/>One of the most popular events is called "Trunk-or-Treat." Members donate candy, cars, and their time to put on a fun, safe, and free Halloween festivity for kids in the local community. Kids are able to get candy knowing it's safe, go through BETA's very own haunted house, and get a flower painted on their cheek on the way home.<br/>In addition to this, BETA TSA teams up with our National Honor Society Chapter to participate in an annual Relay for Life event. Because TSA's national service project is the American Cancer Society, we take great pride in our participation in this event.</p>

            <p class="light center">In addition to BETA TSA's numerous community serice projects, we also have two committees designed to give back to the community: the STPA Committee and the Appreciation Committee.<br/>South Texas Preparatory Academy, or STPA, is the name of the neigboring middle school that also happens to have a TSA Chapter. Every other Thursday, a group of students from our chapter walks over to help out the middle school members with their competitions and gives advice as to how to make the most out of their TSA experience.<br/>Additionally, a group of students who have a passion for showing their gratitude form what is called the Appreciation Committee. They make gifts, sign cards, and purchase tokens of our appreciation for officials in our school and school district, especially when there is a national event for certain people, like Counselor Appreciation Week.</p>
